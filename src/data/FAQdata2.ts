  {
    question: "How do I place an order?",
    answer: "Each week, we'll send you a link to our order form where you can select meals for the following week. This form usually goes out on Sunday or Monday, and you'll have until Friday at 10am to submit your order. This allows our admin team time to organise everything the kitchen needs to prepare for the week ahead."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to order every week?",
    answer: "Nope! You're in control. Pause or skip anytime. Once you've topped up your account, you can order as much or as little as you need each week. If you're a regular, your account manager may send you a gentle reminder to check in. We know how busy life can get!"
  },
  {
    question: "How does delivery work and can I have the option to pick up?",
    answer: "We deliver meals Sunday through to Thursday. As everything is packed fresh daily, deliveries begin from 4:30pm onwards. You'll be notified by your account manager or delivery driver with your delivery window. Pick up is an available option at our Richlands location!"

  },
  {
    question: "How do I let you know about my allergies or dislikes?",
